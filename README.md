## Intro

<img align="left" src="qsourcelogger/data/qsource-128.png"> QSOurce Logger is an attempt to provide a flexible amateur 
radio logging program for both general logging
and beginner to intermediate contesting. It is cross-platform and leverages existing CAT interface layers
for CAT control.

The project was originally forked from Not1mm - thanks to the original authors for the starting point and inspiration.

The QSO entry interface is partially informed by n1mm+ with additional windows and tools available to enhance the experience
of making amateur radio contacts.
