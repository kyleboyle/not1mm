[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/qsource-logger)](https://pypi.org/project/qsource-logger/)

## Intro

<img align="left" src="qsourcelogger/data/qsource-128.png"> QSOurce Logger is an attempt to provide a flexible amateur radio logging interface for both general logging
and beginner to intermediate contesting. It is cross-platform and leverages existing CAT interface layers
for CAT control.

The project was originally forked from Not1mm - thanks to the original authors for the starting point and inspiration.
